                    <div class="textTitle">Who we are</div>
                    <p>We are the post modernism of music, the new elite och the new age of metal. A smal indé metal band from sweden revulutionizing how we all hear sound itself. Every member of the band has an IQ of at least 250, macking us the most intelectually capable band you will ever have the privlige to hear, let alone discover.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="textCategory">
                    <div class="textTitle">The vocalist</div>
                    <p>With a voice of angles and demons capable of singing in 214 unique notes. He converted innocent maidens to not so innocent maidens with his powerful voice. Legends are told about his way of dealing with those who oppose him, with his ruthless technique by screaming at them to a brutal death suffering. Depending on his energy levels, his iq stands between 251 to 298.</p>

                <div class="textCategory">
                    <div class="textTitle">The drummer</div>
                    <p>With the best drummer to ever graze the earth, he can play any drum at 1210 bpm (beats per minute) but rarely does so, for it is too tiering. The drummers iq as tall as his bpm on the crash cymbal, 291.45bpm. He is also the gratest driving force of the creative prosses of our masterpices (se "clamydia at five" and "parkensons desese" for prof of that statement).</p>
                </div>

                <div class="textCategory">
                    <div class="textTitle">The bassist</div>
                    <p>An absolutely feice basist, capible of playing so loud yet so silently, efortlessly skipping time signatures from 17/8 to 11/8 and 5/4 right back to where he started in less than a second at 200 bpm. As an literal bass god, he is faster than ones mind can prosses, well any regular mind at least. With an towering IQ of 274 he is an master of all siences and maths. Many regular minds simpely can not fathem his playing style, it is too sofisticated to be prossesed by someone with 210 IQ and below.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="textCategory">
                    <div class="textTitle">The guitarist</div>
                    <p>Nobody knows where or when the gituarist was born, he has never cried, laufed, or shown any emotion. Rumers goes around that he is not even human to begin with, but rather a robot construked by someone, somhow. He is, one of if not the ost, ruthless man to ever live. The cold and unfeling nature of his beeing is reflected whifin the bands unice style and gituar sound. With a monsturus IQ of 301 he is the most intelectualy gifted of the band, a part of the 0,00012% of individuals who can farhem the advanced tecnikes you will ony find in this band.</p>

                    <div class="textTitle">The manager??</div>
                    <p>Profound manager, is he fire at his job or is he fired? No one knows because he left them burning. with his eneormous welth in both capital and love, the band never gets enogh. He is the spirit, he is the guardian, he is a friend, he is a farther to us. Long may he live with his glorious iq of 277. </p>
